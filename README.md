                   allow read, create : if true;
                 allow delete : if request.auth.uid != null;
                 allow update : if request.auth.uid != null;
                 allow list: if request.auth.uid != null;
               }
               match /{document=**} {
                 allow read : if true;
                 allow delete : if request.auth.uid != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.userType == "Super Admin";

   ```js
       {

               ]
           }
       }
   ```
1. In your terminal at the root directory of the project, build and deploy using the following command
   - `firebase deploy`
